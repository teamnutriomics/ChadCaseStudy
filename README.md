# ChadCaseStudy
A Case Study of the Country of Chad - Analyzing micronutrients for a 19-30 year old man.

This project was created by Team Nutriomics of The Junior Academy.

The code contained within this repository is meant to serve for a case study of a 19-30 year old man in Chad. Anybody with a Java IDE and compiler may edit and run this code.

In the runner class, "day", the user may input micronutrient consumption in milligrams for a given day. The defaults are set to zero. By running this code, the console will print out recommendations to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies, tuned to the age and geographical region of the user (in this case study, a 19-30 year old man from Chad).

This program serves as a prototype of our full plan, which is to convert the user's food consumption data to raw micronutrient consumption information and then run it through a program similar to this, returning recommended realistic dietary changes that make sense given the user's demographics (using locally-available food sources).

Please comment any questions or suggestions on our Github or our post on Launchpad. Thank you!
